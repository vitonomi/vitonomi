## What is vitonomi?

vitonomi is a privacy-first, self-hostable storage platform for the
sensitive personal data you don't want scattered across corporate
clouds. At MVP, vitonomi stores **credentials** (a zero-knowledge
password manager) and **email aliases** (receive-only addresses on
`vito.gg` or any custom domain you own). Photos, videos, documents,
and more types follow in v1.1+ on the same data layer.

You hold the keys. The hub stores opaque ciphertext. Your vaults
store opaque encrypted chunks. Even our own servers can never read
your data — the architecture forbids it.

**Architecture in one sentence.** Users run one or more **vaults**
(storage daemons on home hardware or a VPS) coordinated by a thin
**hub** (control plane); clients reach their main vault over libp2p;
inbound mail to alias addresses is encrypted in RAM by the open-
source **`vitonomi-mx`** SMTP receiver and forwarded as ciphertext to
the user's hub.

**Autonomi-compatible from day one.** vitonomi chunks and DataMaps
are byte-for-byte compatible with the
[Autonomi](https://autonomi.com) 2.0 network. In MVP they live on
your vaults; in v1.1 they can be pushed to the Autonomi network as
an additional replica target with zero format migration. See
[`docs/autonomi-compat.md`](docs/autonomi-compat.md).

**Post-quantum end to end.** ML-DSA-65 (signatures), ML-KEM-768 (key
encapsulation), XChaCha20-Poly1305 (AEAD), Argon2id (KDF). No
Ed25519, no X25519. No harvest-now-decrypt-later risk.

## Status

Pre-MVP. The repo is under active development on a public 13-phase
roadmap. Phase 0 (tooling, workspaces, CI), Phase 0.1 (landing site),
and most of Phase 0.5 (post-pivot restructure: AGPL relicense, new
`vault/`/`hub/`/`mx/` workspace stubs, `web/` → `clients/web/` move,
spec-suite foundation in `docs/`) are complete. Phase 1 (`core/`
foundations) is next.

The full plan lives in the workspace-level `PROJECT.md`. Each phase
has a clear deliverable list and verification gate.

## Repository layout

This is the **public** AGPL-3.0 repository. The private repository at
`github.com/vitonomi/cloud` holds only the proprietary hosted-service
layer (Stripe billing, treasury, internal analytics, infra-as-code)
and consumes this repo through its public APIs.

| Package        | Purpose                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `core/`        | Shared library — crypto, types, protocol interfaces, snapshot chain.            |
| `vault/`       | Vault daemon. `vitonomi-vault` binary. Phase 3 stub today.                      |
| `hub/`         | Hub control-plane server. `vitonomi-hub` binary. Phase 4 stub today.            |
| `mx/`          | `vitonomi-mx` SMTP relay. Log-free, RAM-only. Phase 8 stub today.               |
| `cli/`         | User-facing `vitonomi` CLI; dispatches to daemon binaries plus recovery.        |
| `clients/web/` | Next.js App Router PWA. Phase 6 scaffold.                                       |
| `clients/`     | Reserved for future client surfaces (mobile, browser extensions in v1.1+).      |
| `docs/`        | Specification suite (CC-BY-4.0). [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) is the index. |

Everything runs on npm workspaces from the repo root.

## Quick start

Requirements: Node 20+ and npm 10+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vitonomi/vitonomi.git
cd vitonomi
npm install

npm test          # Vitest across all workspaces
npm run lint      # ESLint flat config
npm run typecheck # tsc -b across project references
npm run build     # build every workspace
```

Run the CLI banner (Phase 0 placeholder):

```bash
npm start -w @vitonomi/cli
```

Daemon stubs (`vault`, `hub`, `mx`) currently exit with a
"Phase N stub — see PROJECT.md" message. Real implementations land
in their respective phases.

## Documentation

The specification suite in [`docs/`](docs/) is licensed CC-BY-4.0 so
any party can implement a compatible client. Reading order:

- [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) — suite index + status table
- [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) — components, trust
  boundaries, deployment topology, data lifecycle
- [`docs/autonomi-compat.md`](docs/autonomi-compat.md) — the
  byte-for-byte compatibility commitment
- [`docs/data-format.md`](docs/data-format.md) — every byte that
  vitonomi persists or transmits (incremental from Phase 2 onward)
- [`docs/threat-model.md`](docs/threat-model.md) — adversaries and
  defences (full review at Phase 11)
- [`docs/monorepo.md`](docs/monorepo.md) — workspace topology

Spec docs that land in later phases (`record-types.md`,
`encryption-flows.md`, `protocol.md`, `api-spec.yaml`,
`self-hosting.md`, `relay-ops.md`, `relay-reproducible-build.md`)
exist as stubs today; each points back to the suite index.

## Core boundaries

Four invariants govern this repo and are enforced by code review and
tooling. They are non-negotiable:

- **Encryption boundary.** All crypto lives in `core/`, runs
  client-side, and never crosses into `clients/web/`, `cli/`,
  `vault/`, `hub/`, or `mx/`. Servers never see plaintext.
- **API boundary.** Clients talk to the hub only through
  [`docs/api-spec.yaml`](docs/api-spec.yaml). Streaming protocols
  (libp2p, vault↔hub, mx push) live in
  [`docs/protocol.md`](docs/protocol.md). The private `cloud/`
  repo is never imported from any public package.
- **Self-hosted must work.** Every feature ships a self-hosted code
  path. The hosted offering at `app.vitonomi.com` is one deployment
  of the same AGPL binaries.
- **Open-source trust.** Core, vault, hub, mx, CLI, and web are all
  AGPL-3.0 and reproducibly built where it matters (`vitonomi-mx`
  first). The landing site is also AGPL-3.0 at
  [`vitonomi/website`](https://github.com/vitonomi/website).
